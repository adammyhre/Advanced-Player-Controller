# Advanced Player Controller

This code is not meant to be used as a plug-and-play package, but rather to be used as a reference 
when implementing Advanced Player Controller logic in your own projects.

## Requirements

- Odin Inspector (uses the `Required` Attribute)
- [Unity Improved Timers](https://github.com/adammyhre/Unity-Improved-Timers)

Additional dependencies are included in this repository, but may be moved in the future to [Unity Utility Library](https://github.com/adammyhre/Unity-Utils).
